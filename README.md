//Project description.

This project presents a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using the Bash scripting language.
The game utilizes basic shell scripting constructs and the zenity utility for creating graphical dialog boxes to interact with the players.
The implementation includes functions for initializing the game board, printing the board state, checking for a win condition, and handling player moves.
The Connect 4 game is played on a 6x7 grid, where two players take turns dropping marks X and O into columns. The objective is to connect four of one's own marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent does.
The script allows players to input their moves via graphical dialog boxes, displaying the current state of the game board after each move. 
Additionally, it detects winning combinations and announces the winner, providing an engaging and interactive gaming experience entirely within the Bash environment.

This project demonstrates the versatility of Bash scripting for implementing simple games and highlights the potential for creating interactive experiences using command-line interfaces.
